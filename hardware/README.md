## Overview

This directory contains the complete hardware design files for the Meower ESP32-C3 16-Channel WiFi EEG/BCI Board, created in EasyEDA Pro. 

## What's Included

The files in this directory are from the latest version that was ordered from manufacturers:

- Schematic files
- PCB layout files  
- Gerber files for manufacturing
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Component placement files

## Manufacturing Notes

- **PCB Specifications**: 4-layer PCB, 1mm thickness, standard FR4 material
- **Ordering**: For easiest ordering, use JLCPCB - the component sizes and specifications are optimized for their assembly service
- **Assembly**: Strongly recommend ordering assembled boards from JLCPCB rather than hand assembly
- **Testing**: A testing board with pogo pins is included (as of 2025-07-29). This is the first version and while it allows you to see signals when properly set up, it's not optimal. Alternatively, you can flip the board to access the test points on the bottom.

## Contributing

If you improve the design or fix issues, contributions back to the project are welcome and encouraged by the reciprocal license! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## License

These hardware designs are licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)**. See [LICENSE-HARDWARE](../LICENSE-HARDWARE) for full terms.

Under this license, you are free to:
- Use, study, modify, and distribute these designs
- Manufacture boards for yourself or others
- Create derivative works

The license requires that any modifications remain under the same CERN-OHL-S-2.0 license.

## Attribution & Logo

While the license requires maintaining copyright notices, I have a friendly request:

- **For minimal changes** (component substitutions, minor routing adjustments, etc.): I'd appreciate if you keep the Meower logo and board markings intact. It helps users identify compatible hardware and makes me happy :3
  
- **For substantial modifications**: Feel free to update the board markings as needed for your derivative work. Just ensure you comply with the license attribution requirements.

## Trademark

"Meower" is a trademark. See [TRADEMARK.md](../TRADEMARK.md) for usage guidelines. You can use the design files freely under the hardware license, but please respect the trademark when naming derivative products.
